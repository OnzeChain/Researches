# Polkadot research

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a protocol that connects blockchains — allowing value and data to be sent across previously incompatible networks (Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example). It’s also designed to be fast and scalable. It’s designed to facilitate an Internet where independent blockchains (parachains) can exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot relay chain.

## What are specific features of Polygon infrastructure?

Polkadot could handle around 1500 tps per parachain, however, it is limited to around 100 prachains. Block finality is 60 seconds for between parachains and up to 60 minutes in bridges. It is built using Rust and the Substrate framework.

## What are the costs of using Polkadot?
Fees on the Polkadot Relay Chain are calculated based on three parameters:
-A Weight fee
-A Length fee
-A Tip (optional).

Average gas fees are around 20 - 50 cents for performing on-chain actions.

## How is the community of Polkadot?

Polkadot community is big and there are many existing resources for developing and launching dApps on the network. However, there is some bad reputation in the community and insecurity surrounding the distribution of DOT supplies.

## How is developing on Polkadot?

Polkadot developers could utilize and deploy parachains on Kusama which is a scalable, multichain network for radical innovation. There are currently 73 projects built on Polkadot. Polkadot uses Parity Technologies' Substrate modular framework, which allows developers to select specific components that suit their application-specific chain best. Substrate dramatically reduces the time, energy and money required to create a new blockchain.

## Pros and cons of Polkadot

#### Pros :

- Reduced time, energy and money required to build and blockchain
- Parity Technologies' Substrate modular framework offers developers the flexibility to select specific components that best suit their application-specific chain
- Polkadot allows developers to launch chains and applications leveraging a shared security model, without having to worry about attracting enough miners or validators to secure their own chains.
- Polkadot has already raised nearly $200 million, become a top ten coin by market cap, and started to be integrated with other networks, like Chainlink.

#### Cons:

- Long finality times with external blockchains
- Limited number of parachain slots
- In the past two years, hackers have exploited code vulnerabilities and caused millions of dollars of damage before they were discovered.
- Bad reputation for it in the community.
- Competes with Ethereum, Cardano, Cosmos and other which have demonstrated network effects
- still a work in progress and has a lot to prove

## Conclusion

Polkadot is built with the purpose to be the “Internet of blockchain”, allowing individual chains to operate on the same network, helping to solve the current problems of scalability, interoperability between different chains to make the application of crypto easier.
Because there is no perfect blockchain that can support all activities in the crypto world, Polkadot will help the development of chains become more specialized, creating an efficient network. Built by the people who know the best about crypto development, Polkadot's ability in the future is worth the trust.
