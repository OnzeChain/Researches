# Avalanche research

## What is Avalanche?

Polygon is a “layer two” or “sidechain” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network’s native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more.

## What are specific features of Avalanche infrastructure?

There could be up to 4500+ tps per subnet and there could be  many subnets on the network. It uses proof of stake (PoS) model as well as other protocols like the DAG-optimized consensus protocol for high throughput and it is built on Solidity . There is a total supply of 720 millions tokens which makes AVAX a deflationary asset.

## What are the costs of using Avalanche?

Gas fees on the Avalanche network start from 0.001 AVAX for transactions and could go up to 1 AVAX for other on-chain actions like creating a subnet.

## How is the community of Avalanche?

Avalanche is currently one of the biggest blockchain projects and it has a strong social media presence with more than 600.5K followers in Twitter and 35k followers on Reddit. It is also listed on more than 100 exchanges.

## How is developing on Avalanche?

Avalanche allows creation of tailor-made blockchains for different purposes and it is compatible with all available tools in Ethereum . 14 projects are currently being built on Avalanche. Developers of these custom blockchains have complete control over the design, with the only requirement being to participate in securing the core platform.
 
## Pros and cons of Avalanche

#### Pros :

- High speed and scalable for DApps
- Throughput is high and efficient without risking decentralization
- Huge institutional inflows have been attracted. Up to 25 million investment inflow a week (depends  but good signal) 
- Change rules for different subnets
- Avalanche consensus combines the benefits of Nakamoto consensus (robustness, scale, decentralization) and all the benefits of Classical consensus (speed, quick finality, and energy efficiency) without the disadvantages

#### Cons:

-Transactions may be delayed if validators are not in agreement on the status

## Conclusion

Avalanche consensus is a radical breakthrough in distributed systems. It represents as large a leap forward as the classical and Nakamoto consensus protocols that came before it.
