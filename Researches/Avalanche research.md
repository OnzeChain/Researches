# Avalanche research

## What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is a blockchain platform that aims to address the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security and decentralization thanks to its unique Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. Like Ethereum, Avalanche supports smart contracts to run decentralized applications (dApps) on its network. AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche platform, is used to power transactions in its ecosystem. 

## What are specific features of Avalanche infrastructure?

There could be up to 4500+ tps per subnet and there could be  many subnets on the network. It uses proof of stake (PoS) model as well as other protocols like the DAG-optimized consensus protocol for high throughput and it is built on Solidity. There is a total supply of 720 millions tokens which makes AVAX a deflationary asset. AVAX serves as the means to distribute system rewards, participate in governance and facilitate transactions on the network by paying fees.

## What are the costs of using Avalanche?

Gas fees on the Avalanche network start from 0.001 AVAX for transactions and could go up to 1 AVAX for other on-chain actions like creating a subnet. It currently provides users with some of the lowest possible fees and in that way attracts more newcomers to its environment.

## How is the community of Avalanche?

Avalanche is currently one of the biggest blockchain projects and it has a strong social media presence with more than 600.5K followers in Twitter and 35k followers on Reddit. It is also listed on more than 100 exchanges.

## How is developing on Avalanche?

Avalanche allows creation of tailor-made blockchains for different purposes and it is compatible with all available tools in Ethereum. 14 projects are currently being built on Avalanche. Developers of these custom blockchains have complete control over the design, with the only requirement being to participate in securing the core platform.Since Avalancheâ€™s smart contracts are written in the Solidity language also used by Ethereum, it aims to create greater blockchain interoperably by integrating a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, including well-established projects like Aave and Curve and that could further ease the work of development teams.
 
## Pros and cons of Avalanche

#### Pros :

- High speed and scalable for DApps
- Throughput is high and efficient without risking decentralization
- Huge institutional inflows have been attracted. Up to 25 million investment inflow a week (depends  but good signal) 
- Change rules for different subnets
- Avalanche consensus combines the benefits of Nakamoto consensus (robustness, scale, decentralization) and all the benefits of Classical consensus (speed, quick finality, and energy efficiency) without the disadvantages

#### Cons:

-Transactions may be delayed if validators are not in agreement on the status

## Conclusion

Avalanche consensus is a radical breakthrough in distributed systems. It represents as large a leap forward as the classical and Nakamoto consensus protocols that came before it. When it comes to tailor-made solutions in the blockchain industry, Avalanche could prove to be one of the best choices for Defi solutions, however, it has a long way to go and there are still uncertainties about whether it has what it takes to become mainstream or not.
