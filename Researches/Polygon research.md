# Polygon research

## What is Polygon?

Polygon is a “layer two” or “sidechain” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network’s native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more.

## What are specific features of Polygon infrastructure?

Polygon throughtput is around 1K-10K TPS with a 2-second average block time. It uses a proof-of-stake model and it is built on Solidity. There is a total supply of 10 billion tokens.

## What are the costs of using Polygon?

MATIC Gas Fees Remain Low at $0.1-0.5 for transactions as well as other on-chain actions.

## How is the community of Polygon?

Polygon has strong social media presence with more than 1.2 million Twitter followers. Other communication means could be found here: https://polygon.technology/community/

## How is developing on Polygon?

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Polygon developer. Polygon team focuses on developing optimization solutions like ZK and Optimistic rollups which developers could utilize for their projects.

## Pros and cons of Polygon

#### Pros :

- Shares Ethereum developer tools
- Abundance of research - Polygon Zero in particular provides extremely-fast ZK proofs, and its technology might become the future leader for ZK rollups.
- Polygon has a fully customisable tech stack, which offers users with a similar experience to that of Ethereum
- multi-chain system allows Polygon to access and use the full power of Ethereum
- cost of deploying smart contracts - Ethereum - 0.308 ETH - $1350. <-> Polygon $0.31 (5000x decrease!)

#### Cons:

- Still requires the Ethereum network
- Split attention on multiple projects - crypto community doesn't know about them because there are too many to focus on.
- Centralized governance of the PoS chain
	- Governance is currently centralized.
	- The Polygon team single-handedly increased the transaction fee from 1 to 30 Gwei in Oct 2021 to combat spammers. They didn't communicate this with the community or ask for feedback ahead of time.
- Less resistant to DDoS attacks
- There is a chance that with developments in Ethereum 2.0, Polygon will no longer be required as the second layer of Ethereum

## Conclusion

By looking at the workings and potentials of Polygon MATIC, it can be assumed that this platform has shown considerable success in solving the blockchain scalability issues. Furthermore, different blockchain developers can enjoy building their own decentralized network in the wake of provided features and tools from the polygon platform which lets developers access customization options.
