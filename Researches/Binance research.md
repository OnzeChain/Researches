## What is binance?

Binance is a cryptocurrency trading exchange founded by Changpeng Zhao. The company was initially based in China but relocated to the Cayman Islands after increased Chinese regulation threatened its business. Binance quickly became one of, if not the largest crypto trading platforms in the world with its extensive list of trading pairs and relatively low fees compared to competitors. The site's initial lack of KYC (know your customer) restrictions were also appealing to some, though it has since added many KYC measures. (Conway, 2021)
