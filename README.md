# Sprint smart goals

### What does smart mean?

> The SMART in SMART goals stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

> Defining these parameters as they pertain to your goal helps ensure that your objectives are attainable within a certain time frame. This approach eliminates generalities and guesswork, sets a clear timeline, and makes it easier to track progress and identify missed milestones.

# Sprint 1

#### SMART goal

> Gain knowledge about techniques and technologies. To acomplish this we will be researching atleast 5 blockchains and 3 technologies. This way we have a good start on how to tackle this project and understand the way of working. By the end week 10 we will have enough knowlegde to begin forking a swap. 

# Sprint 2

#### SMART goal

> Fork an existing DEX to build on. To accomplish our goalÂ we will fork the Front and Back-End of a swap and understand the code. That includes altering the code to ours. By the end of week 12 we have a working DEX with the basic functionalities such as swapping and adding liquidity.

# Sprint 3

#### SMART goal

> We want to complete test functions for core DEX smart contracts by making sure all of them pass successfully. This would make sure we don't experience any interuptions when presenting a demo our products at the end of the sprint. We want to prepare our front-end for this demo by removing redundant features and applying our Onzechain branding into the layout. When implemented properly there should be a clear emphasis on the core features of the app and all branding instances have to point to Onzechain.      

# Sprint 4

#### SMART goal

> Goal of this sprint is to start developing the NFT Marketplace. This goal would allow us to buy, mint and sell Non-Fungible Tokens as well as look at other available art collections. This goal would be achieved by first creating a working POC where we could test smart contracts for the NFT Marketplace. This goal relevance to the project is that it would bring completeness of functionality for token exchange on our application, which would mean that users would not only be able to swap cryto coins but they will also be able to perform actions on their NFTs (both coins and NFTs are in the scope of crypto tokens).

# Sprint 5

#### SMART goal

> Goal for last sprint of the semester is to launch and connect our exiting layouts. End product should allow users to easily navigate through all features we have implemented. The applications we have must be hosted to the Web and links between them should be established.
