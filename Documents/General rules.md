# General rules

## Preface

The purpose of this document is to establish a baseline for our working processes which we could improve with time. It will be divided into different sections in order to be easier for the reader to follow. Key aspects and sections that this document will include are:

- General working methodology
- Communication and documentation
- Meetings
- Team roles
- Reviewing of documents
- Feedback
- Team sanctions

## General working methodology

The framework we will follow in our daily work in SCRUM.

## Meetings

Scrum meetings will be done every weekday in the morning. If there are lectures from Fontys in the morning, the meetings will take place after them, otherwise meetings will start at 9:30 AM (Dutch time). Meetings should be short and not more than 30 minutes. Each Monday we will plan our goals for the week and on Thursday we will have a short weekly reflection about the work we did.

## Team roles

Each week we will assign a person who will take care of Scrum documentation in our Github board. A team leader assigned by the group will take care of daily meetings planning and make sure the working process is followed by the other group members.

## Reviewing of documents

Before submission of any work at least 2 other people, who have not directly taken part in it, will need to review it. The purpose of this rule is to minimize spelling mistakes as well as make sure people who worked on the documents haven’t missed any important information.

## Feedback

Everyone in the group should give feedback to other people’s work no matter if it is good or bad. If people don’t give feedback at first, the person who is presenting their ideas or work should ask for it. All criticism is valued as it could create new views on the topics.

## Team sanctions

In order to maintain our productivity and working processes, we will create a couple of sanctions for team members who abuse and slow down progress. If a person joins a meeting 10 minutes later or more than the agreed time without informing the team, he would receive one black dot. The first time a person collects 3 black dots, he will have to buy pizza for the team the next time we meet on site. If the person collects 3 more black dots, we will schedule a call with our coach and discuss what we could do to help that person and prevent more delays on our progress. Giving black dots to a team member will happen only after the majority of the team has agreed with the decision. Other ways a person could receive black dots are:

- If he hasn’t done a task that has been assigned to them without letting others know.
- If he doesn’t show up for a meeting without letting others know.
- If he doesn’t take part of team activities like reviewing of documents and giving feedback to other people’s work.
- If he altered other people’s work without informing them about it (fixing spelling and grammar mistakes doesn’t apply)
- If he talks bad things to other people (criticism of work doesn’t apply)
